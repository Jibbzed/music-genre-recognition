# music-genre-recognition
A music genre recognition project for the audio pattern recognition course at UniMi

This project is based on the Free Music Archive (FMA) dataset which can be found here : https://github.com/mdeff/fma

Though the creators of the dataset already provide extracted features, this project aims to process the data from end to end :
* extraction of the relevant features
* dimensionality reduction and clustering
* classification through "classical" approaches like SVM or RandomForest, and machine learning oriented techniques

For this project, the "small" dataset from the FMA will be used, it contains about 8000 tracks of 30 seconds distributed evenly between 8 classes
